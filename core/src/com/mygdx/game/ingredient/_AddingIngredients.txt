ADDING INGREDIENTS TO PIAZZA PANIC

Notes by: Thomas McCarthy

============================================================================================

STEP ONE
IngredientName.java

---

Add the name of the new ingredient to the Enum located in the file.
e.g. to add the ingredient 'SAUSAGE', we append it as so:

    public enum IngredientName {

        BUNS_TOASTED,
        ...
        TOMATO_UNCUT,
        SAUSAGE
    }

Remember that different states of an ingredient need their own entry. I.e. 'SAUSAGE' is a bad
ingredient to add, as sausages will probably need to be cooked, therefore we need to add
'SAUSAGE_RAW' and 'SAUSAGE_COOKED' instead.

STEP TWO
IngredientTextures.java

---

Now that you've 'created' your ingredient, you need to assign it a texture. To do this, we need
to add it to the IngredientTextures HashMap. Go to the file, and add the Ingredient to the
provided HashMap titled 'textures'.
e.g. let's say we want to assign 'SAUSAGE_RAW' the texture of 'ingredient_sausage_raw.png', and
we want to assign 'SAUSAGE_COOKED' the texture of 'ingredient_sausage_cooked.png', we append it as
so:

    public final class IngredientTextures {

        private static HashMap<IngredientName, Texture> textures = new HashMap<IngredientName, Texture>()
        {{
            put(IngredientName.LETTUCE_UNCUT, new Texture("ingredient_lettuce_uncut.png"));
            ...
            put(IngredientName.SAUSAGE_RAW, new Texture("ingredient_sausage_raw.png"));
            put(IngredientName.SAUSAGE_COOKED, new Texture("ingredient_sausage_cooked.png"));
        }};

        ...

    }

Your ingredient is now ready to be used in the game!
